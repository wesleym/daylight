Using Daylight
--------------

1. Create a virtualenv environment. I recommend placing it at `venv/` under the root directory of this repository. I recommend doing this because that's what I do, and goodness help you if you deviate from what I'm doing.

2. Install the appropriate packages as described in `requirements.txt`.

3. Set up the `settings.py` to point to your local database.

4. `python manage.py syncdb` and go nuts.
